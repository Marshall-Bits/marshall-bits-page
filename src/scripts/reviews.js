      "Marcel is an outstanding web development instructor who truly goes above and beyond for his students. From the very beginning, he demonstrated an incredible ability to adapt his teaching style to suit the needs of our diverse class. He encouraged us to ask for help, reminding us that seeking guidance is a vital part of the learning process and something we were investing in by taking the course.\n\nWhat stood out most was his willingness to engage deeply with each of us, even when we hesitated to reach out. He could have simply stuck to the curriculum, but instead, he made himself available, answering questions, offering thoughtful advice, and creating an environment where learning felt approachable and exciting. Marcel frequently went beyond course hours to offer additional support, ensuring we were on track and confident in our progress.\n\nHis expertise was evident as he shared tips, tricks, and insights far beyond the standard course material. Rather than simply giving us answers, Marcel encouraged us to think critically and work through problems, building both our confidence and problem-solving skills. He made us feel like part of a team rather than just students in a classroom.\n\nMarcel‚Äôs care extended beyond the technical aspects of web development‚Äîhe genuinely cared about our well-being. He frequently checked in to ensure we were rested, healthy, and in the right mindset to succeed. His holistic approach to teaching made the experience at Ironhack truly exceptional.\n\nI can‚Äôt believe how much I learned in such a short time, and I credit much of that to Marcel‚Äôs incredible teaching and mentorship. I highly recommend him to anyone considering learning web development‚Äîyou couldn‚Äôt ask for a better instructor!",

You can tell from miles away when someone enjoys teaching and has a true passion for what they do, a quality that is not as common as it should be.\n\nThroughout the course, Marcel not only answered every question with dedication, but also gave us the confidence and motivation to face the challenges of this new career path. Thanks to him, I not only acquired technical knowledge, but also the confidence to continue growing in this career.\n\nThank you, Marcel, for everything you do!",

      "I had the pleasure of being one of Marcel‚Äôs students at @Ironhack and from day one, he was always ready to help, make us feel at home, and clear up any doubts. At the start of each class, we had ‚Äústand-up‚Äù meetings where he encouraged us to share how we were feeling, talk about anything we didn‚Äôt fully understand from the day before, or highlight positive moments. He always made sure to take notes and go over anything that needed more attention, as much as needed.\n\nMarcel‚Äôs passion for programming and his deep (deeeeeep) knowledge really stand out. He has a special way of explaining things that makes programming seem easy (even though it‚Äôs not!üòÖ). \n\nThanks to him, I not only learned so much but also felt a spark that keeps me motivated to continue growing in this field.\n\nThank you, Marcel, for giving me the push I needed for this new career path!! ü´Çü¶æ",
